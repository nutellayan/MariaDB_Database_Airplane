#### Edinburgh Airport Database Project
Frequent fliers at Edinburgh International Airport have raised concerns about poor organization and inefficiencies in airport operations. In response, airport management has decided to implement a centralized database system to streamline information management. This project involves designing and implementing a relational database to support key airport functions, particularly around aircraft maintenance, employee management, and regulatory compliance.

#### Project Objectives
Structure and store data related to airplanes, technical staff, certifications, and union affiliations.
Ensure relational integrity and normalization across all entities.
Support efficient querying for operational oversight and regulatory reporting.
